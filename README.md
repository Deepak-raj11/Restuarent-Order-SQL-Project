# Restuarent-Order-SQL-Project

# Introduction
In the restaurant industry, data plays a crucial role in optimizing operations, managing customer preferences, improving inventory management, and boosting overall profitability. In this SQL project, we analyze a Restaurant Orders Dataset to derive actionable insights that can help the restaurant improve its services, streamline its menu offerings, and optimize customer satisfaction.

We will use SQL to explore various aspects of the dataset, such as popular menu items, peak ordering times, customer behavior, and profit margins. The analysis will reveal patterns and trends, and offer data-driven solutions to common challenges faced by restaurants, such as menu optimization, demand forecasting, and improving customer service.

# Dataset Description

### Order ID: A unique identifier for each order.
### Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
### Customer Name: Full name of each customer.

### Menu Item: The name of the ordered item.
### Category: The food category 
### Meal Names : Diffirent dishes
### Price: The price of the individual menu item

The goal of this project is to use SQL to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, helping restaurant managers make data-informed decisions.
